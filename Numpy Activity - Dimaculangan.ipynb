    "## NumPy for Machine Learning Programming Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this programming activity, you will practice using NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing, in the context of machine learning. NumPy provides efficient data structures and functions for working with arrays, which are fundamental for many machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "- For each question, write a code snippet using NumPy to solve the problem.\n",
    "- Your answer should be written as a code block that demonstrates the solution.\n",
    "- Additional operations beyond the discussed ones may also be useful in solving the questions.\n",
    "- Feel free to refer to the NumPy documentation\n",
    "- Read each question carefully and provide the code snippet that solves it.\n",
    "- Test your code to ensure it produces the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "- Your code will be graded based on correctness, adherence to the instructions, and clarity of your code.\n",
    "- Make sure your code is well-structured, commented, and easy to understand.\n",
    "- Remember to run your code and verify the output before submitting your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring System\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NumPy Solution:\n",
    "- 3 points: The solution meets all the parameters mentioned above, demonstrating a thorough understanding and efficient use of NumPy.\n",
    "- 2 points: The solution is mostly correct and adheres to the instructions, but may have minor issues or could be optimized further.\n",
    "- 1 point: The solution partially meets the requirements, but there are significant issues or deviations from the instructions.\n",
    "- 0 points: The solution does not address the question or provides an incorrect solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Solution (Deduction Points):\n",
    "- Deduct 1 point from the total score, regardless of correctness or code quality, if a Python solution is provided instead of a NumPy solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total score for each question will be the maximum points earned in either the NumPy solution category or the Python solution category. If a NumPy solution is provided, the deduction points will not be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer each question with the appropriate code snippet using NumPy operations. Good luck!"
